CHANGELOG
=========

Updates
-------

1.4
---

WinCopies.Data (1.0)
------------------

First release

WinCopies.IO (1.0)
------------------

First release

WinCopies.Util (2.0)
--------------------

- Added:
	- Classes:
		- EnumComparer
		- ArrayAndListBuilder class to build arrays, lists and observable collections like the .Net's StringBuilder does.
	- Methods:
		- EqualityComparison delegate
		- ToStringWithoutAccents string extension method
		- Extension methods for LinkedLists
		- Extension methods for setting properties in BackgroundWorkers with an is-busy check.
		- 'SetField' static method.
		- The view model classes now have the OnAutoPropertyChanged method to automatically set an auto-property and raise the PropertyChanged event.

- Bug fixes:
	- Bug fixed in the BackgroundWorker class: when aborting, the RunWorkerCompleted event was raised twice.
	- Bug fixed in the BackgroundWorker class: when finalizing, an invalid operation exception was thrown if the BackgroundWorker was busy; now, the BackgroundWorker aborts the working instead of throwing an exception.
	- Bug fixed in the Is extension method when setting the typeEquality parameter to false.

- Major updates:
	- The BackgroundWorker class now resets its properties in background.
	- The 'If' methods perform a real 'xor' comparison in binary mode and are now faster.
	- The ApartmentState, WorkerReportsProgress and WorkerSupportsCancellation properties of the IBackgroundWorker interface are now settable.
	- The IsNullConverter class now uses the 'is' operator instead of '=='.

- Removals:
	- The redundant 'performIntegrityCheck' parameter in one of the 'SetProperty' methods has been removed.

- Updated doc.
