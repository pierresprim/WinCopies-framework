------------------

First release

WinCopies.Util (2.0)
--------------------

- Existing items behavior updates:
	- WinCopies.Util.BackgroundWorker class:
		- The BackgroundWorker class now resets its properties in background.
		- If a ThreadAbortException is thrown, and is not caught, in the background thread, the BackgroundWorker will consider that a cancellation has occurred.
		- Info can now be passed to the Cancel and CancelAsync methods.
	- The 'If' methods perform a real 'xor' comparison in binary mode and are faster.
	- The 'If' methods now set up the out 'key' parameter with the second value and predicate pair that was checked, if any, instead of the default value for the key type when performing a 'xor' comparison.
	- The ApartmentState, WorkerReportsProgress and WorkerSupportsCancellation properties of the IBackgroundWorker interface are now settable.
	- The IsNullConverter class now uses the 'is' operator instead of '=='.
	- WinCopies.Util.Collections.ObservableCollection class:
		- Now calls base methods for avoinding reentrancy.
		- Now have the Serializable attribute

- Added:
	- Classes:
		- EnumComparer
		- ArrayAndListBuilder class to build arrays, lists and observable collections like the .Net's StringBuilder does.
		- Comparer classes and interfaces for sorting support.
		- An advanced ObservableCollection.
	- Interfaces:
		- IDeepCloneable
		- IDisposable
		- IObservableCollection
		- IReadOnlyObservableCollection
	- Delegates:
		- EqualityComparison
		- FieldValidateValueCallback*
		- FieldValueChangedCallback*
		- PropertyValidateCallback*
		- PropertyValueChangedCallback*
		- ActionParams
		- Func
		- FuncParams
	- Methods:
		- Static methods:
			- 'SetField' static method.
			- 'Between' static methods for the other numeric types.
			- 'ThrowIfNull' static method.
			- 'GetOrThrowIfNotType' static method.
			- 'GetIf' methods.
		- Extension methods:
			- ToStringWithoutAccents string extension method
			- Extension methods for LinkedLists
			- Extension methods for setting properties in BackgroundWorkers with an is-busy check.
			- Extension method for throwing if an object that implements IDisposable is disposing or disposed.
		- Misc:
			- The view model classes now have an OnAutoPropertyChanged method to automatically set an auto-property and raise the PropertyChanged event.
			- The ReadOnlyObservableCollection has now an OnCollectionChanging protected virtual method.
	- Parameters:
		- The WinCopies.Util.Extensions.SetProperty/Field now have multiple new optional parameters to extend the capabilities of these methods.

- Bug fixes:
	- BackgroundWorker class: when aborting, the RunWorkerCompleted event was raised twice.
	- BackgroundWorker class: when finalizing, an invalid operation exception was thrown if the BackgroundWorker was busy; now, the BackgroundWorker aborts the working instead of throwing an exception.
	- Is extension method: error when setting the typeEquality parameter to false.
	- String extension methods: unexpected results.

- Removals:
	- The 'performIntegrityCheck' parameter in 'SetProperty' methods has been replaced by the 'throwIfReadOnly' parameter.

- Misc:
	- ReadOnlyObservableCollection's CollectionChanging event has now the protected access modifier.
	- Updated doc.
